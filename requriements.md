Software Requirements

Vision:
The vision of this product is to help our users plan dates. We strive to make the process less overwhelming by putting all the necessary info in one place. Users will flock to our app to research activities to do on a date and create a list to keep track of things-to-do/plans i.e. calling for a reservation, buying tickets for a movie, etc.

Pain Point:
The pain point this project solves is planning the “perfect” date to surprise or even just spend time with your loved one is never an easy choice. There is so much research and uncertainty that can come into play. Especially if you have never visited a certain restaurant, or bar, or venue. Our app keeps track of these places and even allows you to add new places. You can comment and review how it went and as people visit those places they can also review, or upvote that place. This puts the uncertainty and time spent planning into our capable hands. 

Care Because:
Not all of us are planners, our app takes that into account as well. Why be punished for planning a crumby date, with our random date generator, answer a few questions and PRESTO SHAZAM, you’ve got your self a random list of dates to choose from. Care because the person you take on the created date should feel special, let us lift the weight and make you look like America’s Next Top Model.

Scope:
